BestImage Browser
=================

[![]http://i68.tinypic.com/bjhcnt.jpg(https://git.ask.com/villanuevat/best-image)

A user interface for testing out the bestImage module, and to experiment with various alterations to the
image scoring configuration and algorithm. 

**BestImage** has a simple interface for simply retrieving the "best image" given a URL, and a "query",
which is a string which represents the kind of information one might be seeking on this particular page.  
The quality of the result returned will be dependent on the construction of the destination web site.  If
the webmaster, for example, tries to highlight directly the relevant image using meta tags (og, twitter, etc.)
Then this will be preferred, otherwise a scoring algorithm is used based on characteristics learned on what
makes for a good image, including matching to the provided query, and title of the document.

**BestImage** also provides a way for you to do your own scoring by either modifying the scores provided by BestImage,
or by overriding them fully with your own scoring algorithm.  


About the Scoring Function (scoreFn) which can be passed to getBestAltImage

provide a callback to post-adjust the default scoring algorithm for an array of image objects.  If specified, this
callback by default will be called after bestImage has completed it's scoring.  The scores for all objects
will be between 0 and 1, with the highest scoring item always being at 1.  

The array of objects will be as follows:

```
 { src: image src tag from document
   alt: optional title (alt text) for image
   class: class name of image tag
   isMeta: image was specified in meta tags (curated)
   docTitle: title of source document and/or query used to generate it
   score: <the calculated score>
 }
```
If you pass in replace=true, then the default scoring algorithm is bypassed, and all scores will be set
to 0.

Your callback should be of the form:

```
function(imgArray) {

    // do your processing
    imgArray.forEach(function(item)) {
    item.score = myScore(item);   // array is altered in place
    }
 }
 ```

*Usage:*
```
BestImage.getBestImageAlt(documentUrl, query, function(imgArray){}, function(err, imgSrc) {});

```

###getBestImageFromDocument

Same as getBestImage except it does not retrieve the document via HTTP, but rather uses the HTML document passed in.  the fullUrl paramater
is simply used for logging.

Returns the src tag (to be used in an <img> tag, or as a paramater to url() in a background-image css tag) of the best image
found on the given document.  Returns null and an error if not image was found.

Note, this is an asyncronous call, and can take a material amount of time depending on the speed of the site being crawled.

*Usage:*
```
BestImage.getBestImageFromDocument(htmlDocument, query, function(err, imgSrc) {});

```

## Installation

  npm install best-image

## Tests

Tests are located in best-image_test.js.  You will need mocha installed, and set the node environment to "test".  
Run the tests from the shell with

```
NODE_ENV='test' mocha test/best-image_test.js --reporter spec
```
